# Antibiotics_Cure_Zombification
This is a simple mod for Project Zomboid that makes antibiotics cure zombification. Why? I play susceptible overhaul, and set it so that everybody is susceptible. That's hard enough. Also, why can't the disease be bacterial? There is a variant version that makes antibiotics suppress but not cure zombification.
